# Becoming Sherlock Holmes

**Author:** Juan Hernandez
**Course:** CSN-190-CyberSecurity Project
**Semester:** Fall 2025
**Institution:** Bronx Community College

## Project Overview
In this Project I used a GitHub repository called Sherlock in order to help me find social media accounts of people or an organization to help see if they are real or fakes.
The example I used in the project was to find the social media accounts of WWE and the results I got were what I was looking for such as getting the actual YouTube channel of the company and some social media sites like Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, and Instagram.

## Software/Tools used
- Sherlock v0.16.0
- Visual Studio Code

## Key Deliverables

- `/resources/` - All research used in project
- `/src/` - source code and project files
- `/docs/` - Documentation and guides
- `/final-paper/` - Research paper and article
- `/images/` - Screenshots and visual documentation

## Getting Started
Make sure to install Visual Code Studio and use the AI in order to help you get the Sherlock software set up if you are having trouble doing so.
Afterwards, make sure everything is working and test it to see if it does.

## Results Summary
I learned that there are tools out there that are very useful to help you figure out any vulnerabilities someone or something might have and by using this software it can help you identify them and figure out how to solve them.
Trying this tool out also helped me realize that not all cyber security tools are hard to use because this one was very simple and easy to set up and use right away, I did have some trouble like with not being able to install python but the AI did help me in that regard.
When using this tool I learned that it scans over 400+ social media sites so you might get results from places you never even heard of before and I think that is really interesting to see.
I am very happy that I was able to find out about this tool and being able to set it up myself and learn and hopefully teach it to someone is something I am very excited to accomplish.
