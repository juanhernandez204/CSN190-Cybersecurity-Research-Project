# CSN190-Cybersecurity-Research-Project

Juan Hernandez This course will task me into creating a project that deals with any cybersecurity aspects and will help me by showing skills I have learned so far and see what I can do.
Cybersecurity is interesting to me because with the way technology is now there are so many way to be able to hack into things and find vulnerabilities and there's always better security and I want to learn that to
better protect myself and others.
