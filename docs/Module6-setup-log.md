The project I cloned was this one: https://github.com/DavidProbinsky/RedTeam-Physical-Tools.

The steps I followed were the ones provided by the instructor and from other videos and also using chatgpt to help assist me when I didn't get an answer from the other steps I watched.

Only command I ran was **git --version** in order to check if my laptop was able to detect the git so I can get the option of cloning gits because it wasn't showing up.

Only problem was not being able to see the option to clone a repository and it was solve with installing git onto my windows device.
