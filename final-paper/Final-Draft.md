**Becoming Sherlock Holmes**

Have you ever wondered about how many social media accounts a company might have and might not have? Or have you ever tried to find a specific company account but forgot what the name was? After experiencing it first-hand a lot, I decided to use this software to help me identify an account, easier or better. This article will be about the software called “Sherlock” which users can use to find social media accounts for someone or a company. This amazing tool can help show you the ways of finding social media accounts of individuals or companies and the great thing about it is that it is easy to use if you aren’t very tech savvy because it gives you instructions on how to set it up and use it. This tool matters in the real world because it can help you figure out if something is legitimate or not because a lot of people will fall into buying or giving money to someone who isn’t who they are and they are scammers or catfishes. As someone who is learning more about cyber security, I’ve seen many ways people try to pretend to be someone else to gain followers, money, etc. Most of this goes unnoticed unless someone who is looking closely figures that something is wrong and investigates and that’s where “Sherlock” comes in.  

I picked this specific tool to use because I just think it is interesting to use and see the results you get. Along with being able to see how many social media accounts someone or a company might have if you want to maybe follow them. Problems that might be solved using this are figuring out if someone is impersonating someone or a company by looking up their names and getting results on it and seeing if they match up with the actual company. This fits into the bigger picture of cyber security because it can be used to see if the person or company you are looking for is being impersonated or fake to avoid being scammed. Considering this day and age it can be easy to impersonate a person or company by simply changing your name to the person or company and making it seem like you are legitimate. This works because some people don’t investigate it that much and might say “oh this is the actual company, let me buy something from here” without checking to see if they are legitimate or not. You may not think it’s true, but there have been many cases in which celebrities get impersonated by others or “catfishing” them to try to get something from others like money for the most part. The tool “Sherlock” is a software that hunts down social media accounts from over 400+ networks like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, etc. This is mainly for analyzing and monitoring because the tool gives you all the accounts associated with a username, and you can see and check for yourself if anything adds up or not and take notes on it. Typically, anyone can use this tool should they need to use it. They can use it if they suspect something is off with an account they are looking for or at and use this tool to help with their investigation to see if the accounts are legitimate or not. What made me interested in testing something like this is the large number of fake accounts I’ve seen throughout the social media platforms I use, mainly Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram. The main reason is because there are ads on those platforms and a good number of them are misleading or fake ads that were generated using AI to try and to deceive people into buying their products or can be AI generated people who want people to give them money even though they aren’t real. Like one time ago an account on my Instagram feed popped up and I was immediately able to tell it was a AI generated person because in every other post something was different and there was a link and it led you to a site where you can subscribe to them to see things and that was the only thing there. I decided to look them up using the “Sherlock” software and when I did there was no other social media accounts associated with the username except the one I mentioned and so I came up with the conclusion that it was a fake account using AI to try to get people to subscribe to them to make money. The crazy thing about it is that things like that aren’t uncommon, there are many accounts like that. It is usually popular for celebrities that are impersonated. I find this tool very nice to use but there are some limitations, for example when using the software, you should be accurate on the name and that you won't get the results you want sometimes.  

Before installing the tool make sure to look at the installation process to see if you can install it at all because some places like Kali Linux need a different way of installing the tool, but overall installation is easy. Some pieces of software you will need to use are Code Visual Studio to help deploy the tool and to assist you install the necessary codes into your system so the tool can run. Other than that, just use either CMD or PowerShell to help verify if your system has indeed installed the proper settings. Also make sure to install Visual Code Studio to be able to see the tool and run it and install the latest version of Git to clone the repository.  

Step 1: Enter this command when beginning the installation process: “pipx install sherlock-project" (quotations are not needed but you can use “pip” instead of “pipx”.) 

This step basically installs the necessary software needed for the tool to function. 

Step 2: Once it has finished installing, verify if you can find what version of the software you installed is detected, ex. (python –version and poetry –version). This tool uses python and poetry to run the tool.

If everything is installed right and you verified if you have the current version of Python and poetry, you should be able to run the tool efficiently. Some common errors is that your device won’t be able to install it because you are missing some features that need to be downloaded in which you can use AI to help you figure out which ones are the ones that you are missing and install them in order to fix any issues with installing Python or poetry.

You will need to figure out up to which version of both Python and poetry you’ll need beforehand.

After everything is done installing, you should be left with this, and you can now use sherlock to find social media accounts that you want to find associated with a username. I used the AI that was provided to me when using Code Visual Studio to help me figure out what I was missing and the next steps to take going forward and installing anything I was missing.

So, to begin, let’s say you want to look up the social media accounts of an entertainment company, for example WWE. You want to set up the Sherlock software to proceed. If you are having trouble, ask the AI that is provided to you to assist you installing the necessary programs like Python and poetry.

In this screenshot, you can see that I used the AI to help me with installing Python and poetry to be able to run the software.

Once everything is installed, you should be greeted with the AI telling you that you can now install the Sherlock.

After installing the AI gives you the commands you can put in to run the software, but each of them requires you to fill out the username and what websites you want to look for. The first command does it for most social media accounts associated with the username you put for it. So, for example, if you wanted to do WWE you would have to type “sherlock WWE” next to the directory and run the command to get the tool running.

You’ll end up with results like this after the tool finishes running, and as you can see, there are many websites that have the username WWE in it.

This article is about research that was done to see how fake social media accounts are and what the potential security risks involved with interacting with these accounts. This relates to the work I did because you can use the same tool to help you with any suspicions you might have about an account that interacts with you and it is of someone famous because you can look into it and check to see if they are legitimate or not and confirm what you think is right.

This article from 2023 is about how fake accounts need to be monitored so that they are unable to cause any harm. It talks about how Twitter is a problem when it comes to this because there are less than %5 of accounts there that are fake and are promoting things like crypto or some other websites that are scams.  

Some challenges were on just trying to get pyhton installed on to my computer because I switched from laptop to a desktop so I had to add everything again and it did annoy me a bit but I was able to overcome it with help from the AI provided to me by using Visual Code Studio. I learned that I could use AI to help me figure out any problems that I am not aware of and use that for future reference so that I can try to do it on my own.  

This changed my understanding on cyber security because in the current environment there are many things that people will do to try to take advantage of you by simply making a fake account or fake websites, etc. It’s getting harder to tell because of the advancements of technology and so learning more about cyber security tools can be very beneficial for you to keep yourself and others safe. One thing I would like to explore more is about finding ways to expose fake things like websites or accounts so that people don’t get hurt by interacting with them and find ways to educate people on the dangers of fakeness in the technology space. I encourage you all to get a basic understanding of current cyber security trends or tools and arm yourself with knowledge about what is going on in the world.
