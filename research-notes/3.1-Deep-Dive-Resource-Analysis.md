* Synosis: This blog gives a rundown and lists several different methods that can be used to impliment physical securities for small businesses. This resrouce is valuable to me because I can find ways that I can research each security implimentation and see how each work and see what vulnerabilities it might have. Some limitations might be software because a cloud based services is needed for cameras to record and store the recordings to be able to view also hardware because cameras will be needed. This is valuable for me because I can see what things are needed to impliment any type of these securities.
