*Type: Checklist
*Synosis: Gives a checklist or list of the types of physical security measures that can be used for a business or for anything you'd want to keep safe and secure and includes the pricing for each tool. This is valuable
because I can write down things that I might need or someone else might need in the future and they have an idea of what to get. Only limitation is pricing because the equipment can cost you a good amount of clams
but if you are willing to spend the money then its a suggetion.

GitHub Project 2: Solokeys. (2025). Solo-1
* Citation: Solokeys. (2025). Solo-1 firmware. GitHub. (https://github.com/solokeys/solo1)
* Type: Security tool
* Synosis: Solo is an open source security key that helps with 2 factor authentication and stronger passwords. It helps with protecting you from phishing attacks and other attacks. Can make logins easier for the
person using Solo. Its key generator like 2FA which can be used once and changes after a certain amount of time. This is valuable for me because 2FA is basically nesscesary and we need better or more ways to make
it more available for people.
* Link: (https://github.com/solokeys/solo1)
* Relevance: 5/5: This shows the importance and other things people can use for 2FA or posibly make it simplier for those who have trouble with it.
