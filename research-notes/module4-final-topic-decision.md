Tools needed for web application security would be software that can test a web application for any vulnerabilities and be able to find ways to fix those vulnerabilities. AI is a technology that can be used to help assist you when finding ways of fixing or identifying vulnerability.
My current capability for physical security is a 3 because while I know about these measures that can be used to protect a small business or any business, I still need to know what other ways can be used to add to what I already know. Also, because some of them like biometric IDs I’d need to learn how to implement them and take notes on how they work. Certifications also because they show whomever I’m assisting, that I have the experience and the knowledge of these things, and I am not sure what credentials I would need. 
For web application testing my current capabilities are 2.5 because I do know how some testing methods work just not all, and I do need to do more research on it and figure out what other methods there are and if there are more services that I can use besides AI. 
For physical security I would test keycards and biometric IDs just to see which one is more effective to use and to see what vulnerabilities there might be for each and account for them and adjust. I’m not sure if realistically it would be ready within 8 to 10 weeks it usually depends on company and the needs but if it’s a small one then 8 to 10 weeks should be enough time for it to function well.
For web application testing I would testing using AI at first and then use other methods to scan them and see if I get different results or similar and then I would note down everything and make adjustments to the AI or the software I use for scanning so that the next time I use it, it scans for everything up to that point for every new application. 
I will include both hands on testing and an evaluation component for both because I think that both need it. For physical security reasons, because there might be adjustments to make during and after testing something to make sure, they function properly and for web application testing it would be the same but for fixing or identifying the vulnerabilities and addressing them.
The challenges that will push my growth would be trying these methods and seeing how I do the first few times and seeing what I can improve later. Like a trial-and-error thing. Passion will sustain me through the difficulties however it doesn’t mean I won’t get frustrated at times, but I will do my best to keep my head up and reach my goals and succeed in them.
Ambitious goal: I’d love to make my own company that specializes in either of these 2 topics and provide services for anyone needing them.
Realistic Target: Gain employment in an area like these topics or something related to it and work my way up and gain more knowledge along the way.
Minimum Viable Outcome: Something to me that demonstrates valuable learning even if incomplete is that I am able to implement something from either topic on my own and test to see if it works well and if it doesn’t then I’ll just see it as a small setback but I can see I can do it.
